              I'm a software engineer who enjoys building clean, calm digital experiences.
              I'm currently exploring art, design, cooking, and how technology can feel more human.

              This space is where I collect everything I create — apps I build, essays I write,
              paintings I make, and recipes I try. It's a living portfolio of my curiosity.
